BirthdayLetter - Wii - Quality of Life Letterbomb Mod.

BirthdayLetter is a mod for a previous exploit LetterBomb.
LetterBomb has served the community for a long time,
However there are some inherit problems down the road with the software.
Letterbomb will cease to work once the date on the webserver of please.hackmii.com gets past 12/31/2035
Letterbomb will stop working for a lot of people if the main website goes down or becomes unreliable.


BirthdayLetter has the following fixes to address these concerns:

1.Static Date of November 19, 2006 (Wii's NA official Release Date).

2.The Python script attached can be used offline and cross platform. Even on a Raspberry pi.

3.Updated the python script to be python 3.9 compatible.

I do not take credit for this exploit, only the offline ability and static time idea.

Check Release Section for Exe's and Python scripts.

Dependencies:

NONE
